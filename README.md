Several modules for thermal emission spectra estimation
- BandPyrometry.jl - Module with function to fit the temperature of the sample surface in predefined spectral range (Optimization.jl and OptimJL.jl are used),
the spectral emissivity of the sample can be approximated as a polynomial
- BandPyrometryTypes.jl  - script file with type descriptions
- JDXreader.jl  - small JCAMP format reader
- Planck.jl  - Planck function derivatives and integrals
- Pyrometers.jl  - Module with varioaus pyrometers types
