There are small julia scripts for thermal emission spectra estimation
- BandPyrometry.jl constains function to fit the temperature of the sample surface in predefined spectral range (Optimization.jl and OptimJL.jl are used)
- BandPyrometryTypes.jl  - file with type descriptions
- EmissivityPoint.jl
